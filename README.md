# SIR-model

Wanted to make a simple slider app to look at  how an epidemic flattens based on the infection rate, time, and recovery rate using the classic SIR model

Couldnt use SEIR or any model with 4 system of equations as it wasn't as fast to update in shiny. Will look into adding in the future along with other ODE problems.
